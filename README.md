## Baseline for ZTE_Challenge2019_Model Optimization and Acceleration
I will open source my previous solutions without tweak.     
Just some experimental code of ideas are shown here, while more general tools may be open source after the challenge.   
    
### Idea List    
1. Merge batchnorm layers to convolution.      
2. Clear some idle filters whose weights are near to zero.     
    
Good luck~
